## Features

- RESTful APIs for managing packages and deliveries.
- WebSocket support for real-time delivery updates.
- Input validation for secure and reliable data handling.
- Middleware support for error handling and request validation.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Package Tracking Backend, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- **Node.js** (version 18.x or higher)
- **TypeScript** (installed globally for development)

## Running the Application

Follow these steps to run the backend application locally:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/package-tracking-backend.git
   cd package-tracking-backend
   ```
````

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Application:**

   For development mode (with TypeScript files):

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   For production mode (after compiling TypeScript):

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The application will be accessible on your specified port (default is usually 3000).

## Functionalities

- **Package Management**: CRUD operations for managing packages.
- **Delivery Management**: CRUD operations for managing deliveries.
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket connections to provide real-time updates on delivery and location status.
- **Input Validation**: Ensures that all incoming data is validated before processing.

## Security Measures

- **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.
- **CORS**: Proper Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) settings are implemented for secure API access.
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive information, such as API keys, is stored in environment variables using `dotenv`.

## Best Practices

### Readability and Clarity
